# machine-learning-bootcamp

An intro to machine learning using examples in Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks will mix R and python code.

## Running the notebooks
Step 0: Make sure you have python3 and virtualenvwrapper installed
Step 1: Make a virtualenv `mkvirtualenv --python=python3 mlboot`
Step 2: Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt` (You may need python3-dev installed to build some packages)
Step 3: Install pytorch using instructions here `http://pytorch.org/`
Step 4: Start the notebook server `jupyter notebook` and play with the notebooks in the browser
